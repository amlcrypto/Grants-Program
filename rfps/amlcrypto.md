## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

We are developing a solution that is a tool for analyzing transactions and addresses of various blockchains. Our solution, the Graph of connections, allows you to investigate incidents with cryptocurrencies, as well as identify stable patterns of user behavior and receive Risk-Score via API.

Our team helps solve problems related to the theft of crypto assets. At the moment, we have helped a large number of users in the investigation of crypto incidents.

Our solution will help the network to provide users with security when conducting cryptocurrency transactions. You will also receive an image component as a company that fights against intruders.
